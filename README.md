## AwesomeVim - For Ultimate Power Users 

AwesomeVim is a cross-platform, lightweight, bloat-free customized editor built on Vanilla NeoVim. This is the configuration that I use daily, and feel free to use it, customize it, and even have a pull request for any additions and recommendations.  

## Installation 

1. Clone the repository and save it as .config/nvim
2. Navigate to .config/nvim/custom and do `nv packer.lua`. Ignore all the errors. 
3. So `:so` to source the file.
4. Do `:PackerSync` to install and sync all the plugins. Done!
