A customizable, fast, and modern Neovim configuration built for an optimal coding experience. Awesome Vim combines powerful features, intuitive keybindings, and popular plugins to create a delightful coding environment. Built upon Vanilla NeoVim, it's fast and flexible for customizations. Its one command installation allows busy developers to set up a fully functional NeoVim code editor on the go without manually installing the most and leverage more than what Vanilla NeoVim can provide. 

## Installation 

Awesome Vim has minimal demands before getting started. You must have the following things installed on your system. 

- **Git**: Version control system
- **Bash**: Unix shell and command language
- **Curl**: Command-line tool for transferring data with URLs
- **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection (for compiling plugins, etc.)
- **NeoVim**: Version **0.5** or later (required for Lua-based configuration and plugins)

All of the packages are available in most package managers, such as Apt, Brew, Pacman, etc. 

### Single-line Command

Copy and Paste this single-line command into your terminal. It's a bash script compatible with Linux, MacOS, and WSL on Windows. 

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PythonHacker24/awesomevim/main/install.sh | bash 
```
Note: This script is under development and may face issues. In that case, use the source code method or create an issue in the [issues tab](https://github.com/PythonHacker24/awesomevim/issues)

### Through Source Code 

1. Clone the repository and save it as .config/nvim
2. Install Packer: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim`. For more info, visit [Packer GitHub](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
3. Navigate to .config/nvim/custom and do `nv packer.lua`. Ignore all the errors. 
4. So `:so` to source the file.
5. Do `:PackerSync` to install and sync all the plugins. Done!

## Features 

- Blazingly Fast: Packed with the most optimal stuff and minimal plugins installed to make it bloat-free. You can add as many plugins as you want through Packer in an easy way.
- LSP Ready: Built-in support for Language Server Protocol for auto-completion, linting, and more.
- Tree-sitter Support: Enhanced syntax highlighting and code folding.
- Integrated Git: Seamless git integration with fugitive and other git utilities.
